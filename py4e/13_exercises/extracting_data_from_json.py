# Extracting Data from JSON

# In this assignment, you will write a Python program, somewhat, similar, to http://www.py4e.com/code3/json2.py.
# The program will prompt for a URL, read the JSON data, from that URL, using `urllib`, and, then, parse, and extract,
# the comment counts, from the JSON data, compute the sum, of the numbers, in the file, and enter the sum below:

# We provide two files for this assignment.
# One is a, sample, file where we give you, the sum, for your testing, and the other is the, actual, data, you need to process,
# for the assignment.

# Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json (Sum=2553)
# Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_2018324.json (Sum ends with 86)
# You do not need to save these files, to your folder, since your program will read the data, directly, from the URL.
# Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.

# Data Format
# The data consists of a number of names and comment counts in JSON as follows:
# {
#   comments: [
#     {
#       name: "Matthias"
#       count: 97
#     },
#     {
#       name: "Geomer"
#       count: 97
#     }
#     ...
#   ]
# }
# The closest sample code that shows how to parse JSON and extract a list is json2.py. You might also want to look at xml3.py to see how to prompt for a URL and retrieve data from a URL.

# Sample Execution

# $ python3 solution.py
# Enter location: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json
# Retrieving http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json
# Retrieved 2733 characters
# Count: 50
# Sum: 2...
