# Extracting Data from XML

# In this assignment, you will write a Python program, somewhat, similar, to http://www.py4e.com/code3/xml3.py.
# The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data, from that UR,L using `urllib`, and, parse, and extract,
# the comment counts, from the XML data, and compute the sum, of the numbers, in the file.

# We provide two files for this assignment.
# One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing, and, the other, is the, actual, data,
# you need to process, for the assignment.

# Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.xml (Sum=2553)
# Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_2018323.xml (Sum ends with 20)

# You do not need to save these files to your folder, since your program will read the data, directly, from the URL.
# Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.

# Data Format and Approach
# The data consists of a number of names and comment counts, in XML, as follows:

# <comment>
#   <name>Matthias</name>
#   <count>97</count>
# </comment>

# You are to look through all the <comment> tags, and find the <count> values, and sum the numbers.
# The closest sample code that shows how to parse XML is xml3.py.
# To make the code a little simpler, you can use an XPath selector string, to look through the, entire, tree, of XML,
# for any tag named 'count' with the following line of code:

# counts = tree.findall('.//count')

# Take a look at the Python ElementTree documentation, and look for the supported XPath syntax, for details. 
# You could also work from the top of the XML down to the comments node and then loop through the child nodes of the comments node.

# Sample Execution
# $ python3 solution.py
# Enter location: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.xml
# Retrieving http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.xml
# Retrieved 4189 characters
# Count: 50
# Sum: 2...
